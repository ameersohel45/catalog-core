// content -- built on pkg/catalog's Fetcher and Resolve, which stay
// backend- and destination-agnostic. Source (discovery) and Sink (handoff)
// are injected because multiple implementations of each are equally valid
// (a DeDi registry lookup vs. a static list; an HTTP push to Discovery vs.
// a local queue) -- unlike Fetcher, where exactly one implementation is

// it is not designed as a swappable plugin surface yet, just enough of a
